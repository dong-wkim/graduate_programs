# Graduate Programs

Find a doctoral program that is fully-funded, online, and in a field that combines medicine with programming (e.g., data science).  
Doing an extramural PhD in medicine **and** a masters in Data Science is not going to be possible on top of residency.  

1. Find information on whether schools outside of the U.S. give stipends/fund doctoral students.
2. Get a list of pre-requisite coursework for non-programming-related students entering into informatics studies.
