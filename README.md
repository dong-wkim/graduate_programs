# Graduate Programs

Find a doctoral program that is fully-funded, online, and in a field that combines medicine with programming (e.g., data science).  
Doing an extramural PhD in medicine **and** a masters in Data Science is not going to be possible on top of residency.  

1. Find information on whether schools outside of the U.S. give stipends/fund doctoral students.
2. Get a list of pre-requisite coursework for non-programming-related students entering into informatics studies. 

## Checklist

**1. List of programs**:
   - [ ] make a list of programs
   - [ ] get a list of universities that are self-paced (start in November/December)
   - [ ] get a list of universities that have January start date
   - [ ] cross-filter for universities and programs and apply
   - [ ] filter list for **online**, fully-funded
   - [ ] prepare application for 5 programs
   - [ ] start by Spring semester of 2026

<!-- Notes/comments:

Online, masters/phd programs in medicine-related informatics:

1. Apply to self-paced programs (November/December)
2. Apply to rolling-admissions/January-start programs
3. Apply to competitive programs for Fall (most of these follow traditional apply-wait 6 months-start timeline)

Possible routes:
1. Straight into doctoral program that is online and medicine-related informatics 
2. Switch into masters in health, medical or biomedical informatics, get PhD at UJ and do post-doc in Biomedical Informatics at UJ/Poland/online
