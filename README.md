# Graduate Programs

**Goal**: Find a doctoral program that is fully-funded, online, and in a field that combines medicine with programming (e.g., data science).  
**Why?**: Extramural PhD in Poland costs 15000-20000z≈Ç for dissertation/defense. And doing an in-person PhD in medicine **and** a masters in Data Science is not going to be possible on top of residency. **Solution**: Find an online masters or PhD program where you can do research, get paid, and enter the technical side of medicine.

1. Find information on whether schools outside of the U.S. give stipends/fund doctoral students.
2. Get a list of pre-requisite coursework for non-programming-related students entering into informatics studies. 

1. Online doctorate degree in health informatics:
   - Rutgers University
   - University of Texas
  
2. Online master's degree in health informatics


Fields:  

   1. **Biomedical informatics**: 
   2. **Health informatics**:
   3. **Clinical informatics**: 

Preferences:  

   1. online U.S. (or fully-funded EU) doctorate program in medicine-related technical field (engineering/informatics)
   2. online U.S. masters program in medicine-related technical field (engineering/informatics)
   3. online doctorate program that is *not* in technical field (engineering/informatics)

<!-- Notes/comments:

Online, masters/phd programs in medicine-related informatics:

1. Apply to self-paced programs (November/December)
2. Apply to rolling-admissions/January-start programs
3. Apply to competitive programs for Fall (most of these follow traditional apply-wait 6 months-start timeline)

Possible routes:
1. Straight into doctoral program that is online and medicine-related informatics 
2. Switch into masters in health, medical or biomedical informatics, get PhD at UJ and do post-doc in Biomedical Informatics at UJ/Poland/online
