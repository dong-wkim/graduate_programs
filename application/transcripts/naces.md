NACES does not perform credential evaluations. However, our members do and can assist you with all your needs pertaining to evaluation services. They can answer all questions related to your specific situation and process. All our members are in good standing, and should be contacted directly for assistance. They are located across the US and work with clients electronically from around the world. Therefore there is no need to be in geographic proximity to an agency. See the directory of NACES members below.
